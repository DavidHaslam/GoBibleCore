# GoBibleCore
Archive of Legacy Java ME Source Code for Go Bible Core

# History
Jolon Faichney originally developed **Go Bible** as a free Bible Text viewer for Java ME enabled feature phones.

In 2008, the **CrossWire Bible Society** formally adopted the Go Bible project by agreement with Jolon.

For further details see https://crosswire.org/wiki/Projects:Go_Bible

Jolon's original source code was hosted by Google.

The program was developed further be several volunteer programmers in succession, ending with Daniel Sim.

During most of that time, the source code was hosted by **CrossWire** using SVN.

Until 1st March 2014, this was the most up to date source code version for **Go Bible** and **Go Bible Creator**.

See https://crosswire.org/svn/gobible/

However, Daniel's **SymScroll** branch of **Go Bible Creator** was developed on GitHub rather than on CrossWire.

See https://github.com/xkjyeah/gobible-creator

**GoBibleCore** was not included in Daniel Sim's repository, hence the putative need for this archive.

### UPDATE: 2017-11-17

This repository was started as a copy of Jolon's legacy code from **March 2008**. 

It is now been updated with the latest code as hosted by CrossWire within the SVN repository.

----------

NB. Go Bible is no longer being actively developed by CrossWire.

This is due to the popularity of smart-phones having largely overtaken feature phones in many countries.

Even so, there are parts of the world where even Android phones are too expensive for many people, so there's still a good opportunity for Go Bible applications to bring God's word to them.
