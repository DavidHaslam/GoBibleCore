Archive of Legacy Java ME Source Code for Go Bible Core

# History
Jolon Faichney originally developed **Go Bible** as a free Bible Text viewer for Java ME enabled feature phones.

In 2008, the **CrossWire Bible Society** formally adopted the Go Bible project by agreement with Jolon.

For further details see https://crosswire.org/wiki/Projects:Go_Bible

The program was developed further be several volunteer programmers in succession, ending with Daniel Sim.

During most of that time, the source code was hosted by **Google Code**.

After Google stopped hosting code, the source code for **Go Bible Creator** was moved to github.

GoBibleCore was not included in Daniel Sim's repository, hence the need for this archive.
